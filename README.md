### A JMRI WiThrottle controller

 - Built around the popular ESP32 microcontroller with built in wifi
 - Fully customizable
 - Easy to use for all in the family.  Set it up once and it just keeps working
 - Once programmed with your JMRI server and wifi information you can turn on/off track power and select a loco using only the buttons and forward switch
 
 This was inspired by the great work of geoffb's [Simple Wifi Throttle That You Can Customize](https://model-railroad-hobbyist.com/node/35652?page=17).  I did a complete rewrite of the software but the hardware is basically the same as his except that I added a small function button and I use an inline microUSB power button to turn it on and off.
